## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è FAQ

### How do I get my Twitch API credentials?

You can get your Twitch API credentials by creating a **new application** (not extensions) in
the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/). Set "OAuth Redirect URL" to `http://localhost:3000/`, set the category
to "Chat Bot" and client type to "Confidential". After that, you will be redirected to the application page.
Get your client ID and client secret from the application's dashboard, and add them to your `.env` file.
After that, you can install [TwitchCLI](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/) and run the following command to get your
access token:

```sh
twitch token -u -s "user:edit user:read:email chat:read chat:edit channel:moderate moderation:read moderator:manage:shoutouts moderator:manage:announcements channel:manage:moderators channel:manage:broadcast channel:read:vips channel:read:subscriptions channel:manage:vips channel:read:redemptions channel:manage:redemptions moderator:read:followers bits:read"
```

You will receive a user access token and a refresh token, add them to your `.env` file.
**Note:** You should run the following command 2 times, once for the bot account and once for the broadcaster account, make sure
to logout of Twitch before running the command again. Put the access token and refresh token in the `.env` file accordingly.

### What's `index.crt` and `index.key` files?

These files are used to run the webserver in HTTPS. If you want to use HTTPS, you can generate these files using OpenSSL
or any other tools. If you don't want to use HTTPS, you can remove the `index.crt` and `index.key` in `index/index.ts`.
